<h1>😀 University - Period 2021/01</h1>

<h2>:scroll: What will you find in this repository?</h2>

<p>Here you will find some codes of the discipline: "Software quality and management" <br>
These are codes in <strong>.java</strong> that I made in the first half of 2021. <br>
I decided to put all these codes here as a backup. <br>
If you encounter a similar problem, maybe I will help you to reason hehehe</p>

<h2>About the language</h2>
<p>All codes were made in the Portuguese language.

If you can't read the language, you may not be able to understand the codes.

⚠️ Perhaps I will return here in the future to redo some logic. 😉</p>
